Credits to valve software for the spit sfx

This is basically just a program that plays a sound and prints a line after 15 seconds in cmd.
Yes, it's hacky, i know. Atleast i tried to make it as clean as possible, lol :P
It consists of a .bat script and a .wav packaged with iexpress.
I created this because i sound stupid whenever there's spit in my throat UGH
Soo, i made this neat little timer to help me fix that! :)
i spent about 2 hours on this program, sigh...

HOW TO USE
Launch Program,
press any key to start the 15 second timer,
spit when you hear the bullsquid attack sound,
have fun!

Press CTRL+C then N to pause, Y to exit. :D
If you are running the .bat and not the .exe, you need a spit.wav in the same directory otherwise this won't work
