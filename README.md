Credits to valve software for the spit sfx

This is basically just a program that plays a sound and prints a line after 15 seconds in cmd.
Yes, it's hacky, i know. Atleast i tried to make it as clean as possible, lol :P
It consists of a .bat script and a .wav packaged with iexpress.
I created this because i sound stupid whenever there's spit in my throat UGH
Soo, i made this neat little timer to help me fix that! :)

HOW TO USE
Launch Program
Press any key to start the 15 second timer
Spit when you hear the bullsquid attack sound
Have fun!

Press CTRL+C then N to pause, Y to exit. :D
